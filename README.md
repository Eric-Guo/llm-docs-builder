# llms-txt-ruby

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress** - This gem is currently under active development and not yet ready for any use.

A Ruby gem that automatically generates [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files for Ruby projects using AI. This gem analyzes your Ruby codebase, extracts documentation from YARD comments, README files, and gemspec metadata, then uses a Large Language Model to create a properly formatted llms.txt file following the official specification.

## What is llms.txt?

The llms.txt file is a proposed standard for providing LLM-friendly content on websites. It offers brief background information, guidance, and links to detailed markdown files, helping Large Language Models understand and navigate your project more effectively.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI-powered generation**: Uses Claude or GPT models to create natural, comprehensive llms.txt files
- üìö **YARD integration**: Extracts rich documentation from YARD comments and tags
- üîß **Configurable**: Supports multiple LLM providers and customizable options
- üñ•Ô∏è **CLI + API**: Use from command line or integrate into your Ruby applications
- üìÅ **Project awareness**: Understands Ruby project structure and conventions
- üéØ **Spec compliant**: Generates files that strictly follow the llms.txt specification

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'llms-txt-ruby'
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```
